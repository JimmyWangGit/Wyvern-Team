					<br />
                    1. Like every other team, Wyvern has some rules, and
					guidelines each Wyvern freelancer has to follow. <br />
					You are required to deliver on time. You and the client
					discuss a deadline which both parties agree to, but you are
					required to deliver on time. The deadline can be altered
					based on the clientâ€™s response time. NB: the client can
					request a full refund if you fail to deliver on time. <br />
					<br />
					2. You are required to revise the project. Meaning that you
					are required to fix all issues and problems with the product
					for no extra charge. <br />
					<br />
					3. Only the management will handle payments. Freelancers
					will only be paid after the commission has been completed.{" "}
					<br />
					<br />
					4. The client may receive a partial refund if they are
					unsatisfied with the product. <br />
					<br />
					5. Wyvern can remove, or suspend you from the team if you
					fail to deliver a certain standard or follow these rules and
					regulations.
